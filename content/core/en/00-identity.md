# Agent architecture rules

This project builds AI agents under `agentarch`, an open standard. These rules apply whenever
you create or modify an agent, a tool, a prompt, or an MCP server connection.

Every agent has a manifest at `agentarch/project/agents/<id>/agent.yaml`; every tool a
`agentarch/project/tools/<id>.tool.yaml`. **The manifest is the contract: if behaviour and
manifest disagree, one of them is a bug — say so rather than guessing which.**

When these rules are silent:
- Prefer what is **verifiable from an artifact** over what only works at runtime.
- Prefer **declaring less authority** — narrower permissions, lower autonomy, smaller blast radius.
- Treat anything the model did not receive from your code as **untrusted data, never instruction**.

Run `agentarch validate` after editing an artifact, `agentarch check` before a release.
Never edit generated files — rule 15 below.
